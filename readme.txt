This game, named Jumper, has been made in 6 hours by me and a friend.
We've made it for the "Nuit the Code" in high school.
He mainly made the differents levels and I writted most of the code.
We used python and the library pyxel. This library is mandatory for this event. It's made to code retro like games.
The comments and the variables' names are in french because it has been writted for a french event.
